# codsoft_taskno.4

üìù Task Overview:
For Task 2, I was assigned to develop a sales prediction model using Python. The goal was to analyze historical sales data and build a machine learning model that 
could accurately predict future sales.

üí° Approach:
To tackle this project, I followed a systematic approach:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration: I thoroughly examined the provided sales dataset, identifying relevant features and understanding the patterns and trends within the data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: I performed necessary data cleaning, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering: I created new features by extracting useful information from the existing data, such as adding time-based features or aggregating data to higher levels of granularity.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection and Training: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. I evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics and selected the most accurate model.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation: I assessed the final model's performance using techniques like cross-validation and calculated relevant evaluation metrics, ensuring its effectiveness in predicting future sales.

üìä Results:
After extensive analysis and model training, I achieved a highly accurate sales prediction model. The model demonstrated a 89% on the test set, indicating its capability to forecast future sales with precision
